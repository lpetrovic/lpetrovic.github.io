However, finding a globally optimal solution is often an insurmountable problem in practice and state-of-the-art trajectory optimization methods are thus prone to local minima, mainly in cluttered environments. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory planning algorithm that employs stochastic optimization in order to find a collision-free trajectory generated from a continuous-time Gaussian process (GP). The contributions of the proposed motion planning method stem from introducing the heteroscedasticity of the GP, together with exploited sparsity for efficient covariance estimation, and a cross-entropy based stochastic optimization for importance sampling based trajectory optimization. We evaluate the proposed method on three simulated scenarios: a maze benchmark, a 7 DOF robot arm planning benchmark and a 10 DOF mobile manipulator trajectory planning example and compare it to a state-of-the-art GP trajectory optimization method, namely the Gaussian process motion planner 2 algorithm (GPMP2). Our results demonstrate the following: (i) the proposed method yields a more thorough exploration of the solution space in complex environments than GPMP2, while having comparable execution time, (ii) the introduced heteroscedasticity generates GP priors better suited for collision avoidance and (iii) the proposed method has the ability to efficiently tackle high-dimensional trajectory planning problems.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-Entropy based Stochastic Optimization of Robot Trajectories using Heteroscedastic Continuous-time Gaussian Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luka Petrović","Filip Marić","Ivan Marković","Ivan Petrović"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"6350db457d631d62d99a742a76d62fee","permalink":"https://lpetrovic.github.io/publication/ifac2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ifac2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper deals with motion planning for multiple agents by representing the problem as a simultaneous optimization of every agent’s trajectory.

For successful fusion, sensor calibration is necessary, while performing it online is crucial for long-term reliability. Contrary to currently common online approach of using ego-motion estimation, we propose an online calibration method based on detection and tracking of moving objects. Our motivation comes from the practical perspective that many perception sensors of an autonomous system are part of the pipeline for detection and tracking of moving objects. Thus, by using information already present in the system, our method provides resource inexpensive solution for the long-term reliability of the system. The method consists of a calibration-agnostic track to track association, computationally lightweight decalibration detection, and a graph-based rotation calibration. We tested the proposed method on a real-world dataset involving radar, lidar and camera sensors where it was able to detect decalibration after several seconds, while estimating rotation with 0.2◦ error from a 20 s long scenario.","tags":[],"title":"Online Multi-Sensor Calibration Based on Moving Object Tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Filip Marić","Oliver Limoyo","Luka Petrović","Trevor Ablett","Ivan Petrović","Jonathan Kelly"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1571091125,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571091125,"objectID":"b88956fbd9cb4fdef6736bb0a9588522","permalink":"https://lpetrovic.github.io/publication/iros2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-15T00:12:05+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/iros2019/","section":"publication","summary":"A significant challenge in manipulation motion planning is to ensure agility in the face of unpredictable changes during task execution. This requires the identification and possible modification of suitable joint-space trajectories, since the joint velocities required to achieve a specific endeffector motion vary with manipulator configuration. For a given manipulator configuration, the joint space-to-task space velocity mapping is characterized by a quantity known as the manipulability index. In contrast to previous control-based approaches, we examine the maximization of manipulability during planning as a way of achieving adaptable and safe joint space-to-task space motion mappings in various scenarios. By representing the manipulator trajectory as a continuous-time Gaussian process (GP), we are able to leverage recent advances in trajectory optimization to maximize the manipulability index during trajectory generation. Moreover, the sparsity of our chosen representation reduces the typically large computational cost associated with maximizing manipulability when additional constraints exist. Results from simulation studies and experiments with a real manipulator demonstrate increases in manipulability, while maintaining smooth trajectories with more dexterous (and therefore more agile) arm configurations.","tags":[],"title":"Fast Manipulability Maximization Using Continuous-Time Trajectory Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marija Seder","Luka Petrović","Juraj Peršić","Goran Popović","Tomislav Petković","Ana Šelek","Borna Bićanić","Igor Cvišić","Damir Josić","Ivan Marković","Ivan Petrović","Ali Muhammad"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568851200,"objectID":"e68eb48c6c8c8f841696482bcdd2aacc","permalink":"https://lpetrovic.github.io/publication/wroco2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wroco2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present the control of a robotic system for automation in manufacturing logistics based on the Open Platform for Innovations in Logistics (OPIL).
